# CORE_Resarch
A repository for my independent research into the CORE platform

data: contains data where 5 traffic flows are run per parameter, each being run for 10 secodns each, and average age is calculated from theoretical equation

data2: contains same data as data, but average age is approximated

data3: contains data where 5 traffic flows are run per parameter and 100 packets are sent per flow on average, average age is calculated with theoretical equation

data4: contains same data as data 3 but average age is approximated
